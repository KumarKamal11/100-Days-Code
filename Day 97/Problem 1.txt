Day 97: Problem-1

Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. 
You can return the answer in any order. An Anagram is a word 
or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different 
word or phrase, typically using all the original letters 
exactly once.

 
Approach:
The intuition behind solving the question is just group words
that are anagrams of each other together.

Iterate through each string in the input vector strs. For each string,
create a temporary string temp by sorting its characters. Use temp as 
a key in the unordered map mp and append the original string to the 
corresponding vector in the map. After processing all strings, iterate 
through the unordered map mp and push each vector of anagrams into the 
result vector ans. Finally, return the grouped anagrams stored in ans.

Code:

 vector<vector<string>>ans;
    unordered_map< string,vector<string>>mp;

    for(int i=0;i<strs.size();i++){
        string temp=strs[i];
        sort(temp.begin(),temp.end());
        mp[temp].push_back(strs[i]);
    }
       for(auto it:mp){
        ans.push_back(it.second);
    }
       return ans;
    }
