Intution:

As We're given a stack st of integers and an element x that needs to be inserted at the bottom of the stack.

1.To achieve this, we use an additional temporary stack temp.
2.First, we iterate through the original stack st and transfer all its elements to the temp stack.
3.Once all elements are moved to temp, we push the new element x onto the original stack st. 
4.Now, x is at the bottom of the stack st.
5.Finally,we transfer all the elements back from temp to st. This restores the original order of elements in the stack.
6.The modified stack st is then returned.

Code:
 stack<int> insertAtBottom(stack<int> st,int x){
        stack<int> temp;
        while(!st.empty()){
            temp.push(st.top());
            st.pop();
        }
        st.push(x);
        while(!temp.empty()){
            st.push(temp.top());
            temp.pop();
        }
        return st;
    }
