Day 52: Problem-1

You are given an m x n integer grid accounts where accounts[i][j] is the amount of money 
the i​​​​​​​​​​​th​​​​ customer has in the j​​​​​​​​​​​th​​​​ bank. Return the wealth that the richest customer has.
A customer's wealth is the amount of money they have in all their bank accounts. The 
richest customer is the customer that has the maximum wealth.

Approach

1. Initialize maxsum to INT_MIN to store the maximum wealth found.
2. Iterate over each person's account using a range-based for loop
3. For each account, calculate the total wealth by summing up the amounts in each account.
4. If the total wealth of the current person is greater than maxsum, update maxsum with the new total wealth.
5. Return maxsum as the maximum wealth among all people.

Code:
 int maximumWealth(vector<vector<int>>& accounts) {
        int row=accounts.size();
        int col=accounts[0].size();
        int maxs=INT_MIN;
        for(int i=0;i<row;i++){
            int s=0;
            for(int j=0;j<col;j++){
                s+=accounts[i][j];
            }
            if(s>maxs){
                maxs=s;
            }
        }
        return maxs;
    }
