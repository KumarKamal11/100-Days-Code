Day 53: Problem-2

Given an n x n binary matrix image, flip the image horizontally, then invert it,
and return the resulting image. To flip an image horizontally means that each row
of the image is reversed. For example, flipping [1,1,0] horizontally results in [0,1,1].
To invert an image means that each 0 is replaced by 1, and each 1 is replaced by 0.
For example, inverting [0,1,1] results in [1,0,0].

Topics: Matrix

Approach

Just Reverse the each row of matrix. After that flip set the zero to one 
and vice versa.

Code:
 
 vector<vector<int>> flipAndInvertImage(vector<vector<int>>& image) {
        int row=image.size();
        int col=image[0].size();
        vector<vector<int>>ans(row,vector<int>(col));
        for(int i=0;i<row;i++){
            reverse(image[i].begin(),image[i].end());
        }
        for(int i=0;i<row;i++){
            for(int j=0;j<col;j++){
                if(image[i][j]==1){
                    ans[i][j]=0;
                }
                if(image[i][j]==0){
                    ans[i][j]=1;
                }
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
