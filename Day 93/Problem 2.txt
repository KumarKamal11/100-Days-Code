Day 93: Problem-2

Given an integer array nums, move all the even integers 
at the beginning of the array followed by all the odd 
integers.Return any array that satisfies this condition.

Approach:

Just simple find even number and swap with the even index which is set to 0 initially.
If even number is find the swap the number with even index and increase the even index

Code:

  vector<int> sortArrayByParity(vector<int>& nums) {
        int eveni=0;
        for(int i=0;i<nums.size();i++){
            if(nums[i]%2==0){
                swap(nums[i],nums[eveni]);
                eveni++;
            }
        }
        return nums;
    }
