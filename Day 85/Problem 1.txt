Day 85: Problem-1

Given a binary tree root and an integer target, delete all the leaf nodes with value target.
Note that once you delete a leaf node with value target, if its parent node becomes a leaf 
node and has the value target, it should also be deleted (you need to continue doing that until you cannot).

Approach:

The simple Approach of solving the question is Traverse the tree using a 
post-order depth-first search. At each node, first recursively process the
left and right children. After processing children, check if the node itself
is now a leaf and needs to be deleted.

Code:
 TreeNode* removeLeafNodes(TreeNode* root, int target) {
        if(root==NULL){
            return NULL;
        }
        root->left=removeLeafNodes(root->left,target);
        root->right=removeLeafNodes(root->right,target);

        if(root->left==NULL && root->right==NULL && root->val==target){
            return NULL;
        }
        return root;
    }
