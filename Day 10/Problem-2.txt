Day 10: Problem-2

Problem:Get min at pop

You are given an array A of size N.
You need to first push the elements of the array into a stack and 
then print minimum in the stack at each pop until stack becomes empty.

Difficulty Level:Easy
Topics: Stack

Approach:
1.Initialize an empty stack and a variable to track the minimum value.
2.Iterate through the array elements.
3.For the first element, push it onto the stack.
4.For subsequent elements, compare with the top of the stack to determine the minimum.
5.Push the minimum onto the stack.
6.Return the stack.
7.Take a stack as input in another function.
8.Iterate through the stack.
9.Print the top element (minimum value) and pop it.
10.Repeat until the stack is empty.

Code:

 stack<int> _push(int arr[],int n)
 {
   // your code here
   stack<int>st;
   int minm=0;
   for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
       if(i==0){
           st.push(arr[i]);
       }
       else{
          minm=min(arr[i],st.top());
          st.push(minm);
       }
   }
   return st;
 }

//Function to print minimum value in stack each time while popping.
void _getMinAtPop(stack<int>s)
{
    // your code here
    while(!s.empty()){
        cout<<s.top()<<" ";
        s.pop();
    }
}
