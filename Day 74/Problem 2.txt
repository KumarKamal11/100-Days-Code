Day 74: Problem-2

Given the array nums, for each nums[i] find out how many numbers in the array
are smaller than it. That is, for each nums[i] you have to count the number of
valid j's such that j != i and nums[j] < nums[i].
Return the answer in an array.

Approach:
This problem ask for finding the count of numbers smaller than the current number in
the given array. My initial thought is to iterate through each number in the array 
and count the numbers smaller than it.The approach involves iterating through each number 
in the array. For each number, iterate through the array again to count the numbers 
smaller than it. Maintain a count variable for this purpose. Finally, push the count into 
a result array for each number.

Code:
 vector<int> smallerNumbersThanCurrent(vector<int>& nums) {
      vector<int>ans;
      for(int i=0;i<nums.size();i++){
        int cnt=0;
        for(int j=0;j<nums.size();j++){
            if(nums[j]<nums[i]){
                cnt++;
            }
        }
        ans.push_back(cnt);
      }
     return ans;
        
    }
