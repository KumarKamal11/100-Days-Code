Problem:Next Greater Element
Given an array arr[ ] of size n having distinct elements,
the task is to find the next greater element for each element
of the array in order of their appearance in the array.
Next greater element of an element in the array is the nearest 
element on the right which is greater than the current element.

Difficulty Level:Medium
Topics: Array,Stack

Approach:
1.We use a stack data structure st to keep track of indices of elements.
2.Initialize a vector ans of size n with default value -1, where the next greater elements will be stored.
3.Iterate through each element of the input array arr.
4.While stack is not empty and current element is greater than top of stack.Set next greater element for top of stack to current element and Pop from the stack.
5.After iterating through all elements, return the vector ans containing the next greater elements for each element in the input array.

Code:
   
   vector<long long> nextLargerElement(vector<long long> &arr, int n){
        // Your code here
        stack<int>st;
        vector<long long int>ans(n,-1);
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            while(!st.empty() && arr[st.top()]<arr[i]){
                ans[st.top()]=arr[i];
                st.pop();
            }
            st.push(i);
        }
        return ans;
    }
