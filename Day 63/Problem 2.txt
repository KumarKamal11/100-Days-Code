Approach

Store Each character in a hashmap and subsequently check if it count is equal to 2.If its 
count is 2 then return that character otherwise rerun.

Code:
    char repeatedCharacter(string s) {
        unordered_map<char,int>mp;
        char ans;
        for(int i=0;i<s.length();i++){
            mp[s[i]]++;
            if(mp[s[i]]==2){
               return s[i];
            }
        }
       return 1;  
    }
