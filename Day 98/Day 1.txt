Day 98: Problem-1

You are given two non-negative integers num1 and num2.
In one operation, if num1 >= num2, you must subtract num2 
from num1, otherwise subtract num1 from num2. For example,
if num1 = 5 and num2 = 4, subtract num2 from num1, thus 
obtaining num1 = 1 and num2 = 4. However, if num1 = 4 and 
num2 = 5, after one operation, num1 = 4 and num2 = 1. Return
the number of operations required to make either num1 = 0 or
num2 = 0.
 
Approach:

Just write the code according to the question.If num1> num2
then subtract num2 from num1 and vice versa.After each step 
till any one of the number does not become zero we have to 
count the steps. At the end return the number of steps. 

Code:

int countOperations(int num1, int num2) {
        int ans=0;
        while(num1!=0 && num2!=0){
            if(num1>num2){
                num1-=num2;
                ans++;
            }
            else{
                num2-=num1;
                ans++;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
