Problem:Generate Binary Numbers
Given a number N. The task is to generate and print all binary numbers with decimal values from 1 to N.

Topics: String

Approach:
The simple Approach is to iterates through each decimal number from 1 to N,
converts it into binary, and stores the binary representation as strings in a vector.
Finally, it returns this vector containing all the binary numbers.

1.Declare a vector of strings named ans to store the generated binary numbers.
2.Iterate through each decimal number from 1 to N using a for loop.
3.For each decimal number i, convert it into its binary representation.
4.Within the loop, initialize a string temp1 to store the binary representation of the current decimal number.
5.While the decimal number num is not zero, perform the following steps:
6.Get the remainder of num divided by 2 (which is the binary equivalent bit).
7.Convert the remainder to a string using to_string() and append it to the temp1 string.
8.Divide num by 2 to move to the next binary digit.
9.Reverse the string temp1 to get the correct binary representation.
10.Push the generated binary string temp1 into the ans vector.
11.After processing all decimal numbers from 1 to N, return the vector ans containing all the generated binary numbers.

Code:
vector<string> generate(int n)
{
	vector<string>ans;
	
	for(int i=1;i<=n;i++){
	    int num=i;
	    string temp1="";
	    while(num!=0){
	        temp1=temp1+to_string(num%2);
	        num=num/2;
	    }
	    reverse(temp1.begin(),temp1.end());
	    ans.push_back(temp1);
   }
   return ans;
}
