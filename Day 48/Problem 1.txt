Day 48: Problem-1

Problem: 2974. Minimum Number Game

You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums of even length and there is also an empty array arr.
Alice and Bob decided to play a game where in every round Alice and Bob will do one move. The rules
of the game are as follows:

1. Every round, first Alice will remove the minimum element from nums, and then Bob does the same.
2. Now, first Bob will append the removed element in the array arr, and then Alice does the same.
3. The game continues until nums becomes empty.
 Return the resulting array arr.

Topics: Heap

Approach

1 Push all elements into min heap (Priority Queue).
2 Then stores first 2 elements each time in ele1 and ele2 which are alice and bob variables.
3 Store these ele1 and ele2 into vector nums and keep repeating this untill queue is empty.

Code:
  vector<int> numberGame(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n=nums.size();
        vector<int>ans;
        priority_queue<int,vector<int>,greater <int>>pq;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            pq.push(nums[i]);
        }
        while(pq.size()!=0){
            int ele1=pq.top();
            pq.pop();
            int ele2=pq.top();
            pq.pop();
            ans.push_back(ele2);
            ans.push_back(ele1);
        }
        return ans;
    }
