Day 86: Problem-1

Given a 0-indexed string word and a character ch, reverse the segment of word that starts at index 0
and ends at the index of the first occurrence of ch (inclusive). If the character ch does not exist 
in word, do nothing. For example, if word = "abcdefd" and ch = "d", then you should reverse the segment
that starts at 0 and ends at 3 (inclusive). The resulting string will be "dcbaefd". Return the resulting string.

Approach:

All we need to do is to find the position of the first occurence of the target char.
Then we need to reverse this part of the string. 

1.Iterate Through the String.
2.Reverse the Prefix
3.At last return the string.

Code:
 string reversePrefix(string word, char ch) {
        int j=0;
        for(int i=0;i<word.length();i++){
            if(word[i]==ch){
                j=i;
                break;
            }
        }
        if(j==0){
            return word;
        }
        int i=0;
        while(i<j){
               swap(word[i],word[j]);
                i++;
                j--;
           }
        return word;
    }
