Approach:

We have to return the length of the last word so it is good to traverse from end of the string.
Traverse from the end of the string. Ignore the spaces at the end of the string.Now increase the
value of length for every s[i] != ' '.Return the length when you get space and your length is 
greater than zero.This is the basic and simple approach for this problem.

Code:
   int lengthOfLastWord(string s) {
        int n=s.length();
        int i=n-1;
        while(i>=0 and s[i]==' '){
            i--;
        }
        int length=0;
        while(i>=0 and s[i]!=' '){
            i--;
            length++;
        }
        return length;
    }
