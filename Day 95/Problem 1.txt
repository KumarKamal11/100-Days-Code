Day 95: Problem-1

You are given two arrays of equal length, nums1 and nums2.
Each element in nums1 has been increased (or decreased in 
the case of negative) by an integer, represented by the variable x.
As a result, nums1 becomes equal to nums2. Two arrays are considered
equal when they contain the same integers with the same frequencies.
Return the integer x.

Approach:

After carefully understanding the question we can say that we just have to
return the difference of minimum element of nums2 and nums1.

Code:

 int addedInteger(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2) {
        int min=INT_MAX,min1=INT_MAX;

        for(int i=0;i<nums1.size();i++){
            if(nums1[i] < min){
                min=nums1[i];
            }
        }
         for(int i=0;i<nums2.size();i++){
            if(nums2[i] < min1){
                min1=nums2[i];
            }
        }
       return (min1-min);
    }
