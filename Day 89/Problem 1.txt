Day 89: Problem-1

Given two strings ransomNote and magazine, return true if
ransomNote can be constructed by using the letters from 
magazine and false otherwise.Each letter in magazine can 
only be used once in ransomNote.

Approach:

We can solve this question by using Hashmap.

1.Create a HashMap called dictionary to store the character counts in the magazine.
2.Iterate through each character in the magazine string.
3.Increment count of charcters which are present in string.
4.Iterate through each character in the ransom note string.
5.Check if the character is present in the dictionary and its count is greater than 0.
6.If both conditions are satisfied, decrement the count of the character in the dictionary.
7.If a character is not present in the dictionary or its count is 0, return false.
8. If all characters in the ransom note have been checked successfully, return true.

Code:
  bool canConstruct(string ransomNote, string magazine) {
        unordered_map<char,int> freq;
        for(char c : magazine){
        freq[c]++;
        }
        for(char c:ransomNote) {
            if(freq[c]==0){
            return false;
            }
            else{
            freq[c]--;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
