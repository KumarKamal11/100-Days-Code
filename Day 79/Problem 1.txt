Day 79: Problem-1

You are given a 0-indexed string blocks of length n, where blocks[i] is either 'W' or 'B',
representing the color of the ith block. The characters 'W' and 'B' denote the colors white
and black, respectively.You are also given an integer k, which is the desired number of 
consecutive black blocks.In one operation, you can recolor a white block such that it becomes
a black block.Return the minimum number of operations needed such that there is at least one 
occurrence of k consecutive black blocks.

Input: blocks = "WBBWWBBWBW", k = 7
Output: 3
Explanation:
One way to achieve 7 consecutive black blocks is to recolor the 0th, 3rd, and 4th blocks
so that blocks = "BBBBBBBWBW". 
It can be shown that there is no way to achieve 7 consecutive black blocks in less than 3 operations.
Therefore, we return 3.

Approach:

Find the first k length substring and keep a count of white.Start decreasing the
window from left and increasing from right.Either subtract white count when 
decreasing window or add when increasing window.Return the min count in the process.

Code:
 int minimumRecolors(string blocks, int k) {
        int i=0;
        int j=0;
        int n=blocks.size();
        int minm=INT_MAX;
        int cnt=0;
        while(j<n){
            char ch=blocks[j];
            if(ch=='W'){
                cnt++;
            }

            while(j-i+1>k){
                char left=blocks[i];
                if(left=='W'){
                    cnt--;
                }
                i++;
            }

            if(j-i+1==k){
                minm=min(cnt,minm);
            }

            j++;
        }
        return minm;
    }
