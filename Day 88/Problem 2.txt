Day 88: Problem-2

You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums of size 3 which can form the sides of a triangle.
A triangle is called equilateral if it has all sides of equal length.
A triangle is called isosceles if it has exactly two sides of equal length.
A triangle is called scalene if all its sides are of different lengths.
Return a string representing the type of triangle that can be formed or "none" if it cannot form a triangle.

Approach:

Just sort the vector and use triangle property.
Just Simple write the code according to the 
Properties of triangle.

Code:
    string triangleType(vector<int>& nums) {
        sort(nums.begin(),nums.end());

        if(nums[0]+nums[1]<=nums[2]){
            return "none";
        }
        else if(nums[0]==nums[1] and nums[1]==nums[2]){
            return "equilateral";
        }
        else if(nums[0]==nums[1] or nums[1]==nums[2]){
            return "isosceles";
        }
        else{
            return "scalene";
        }
    }
