Day 54: Problem-1

Problem:Given the root of an n-ary tree, return the postorder traversal of its nodes' values.
Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal. Each group of 
children is separated by the null value.

Topics: Binary Tree

Approach

We will use same binary tree postorder travesal concept But,
Unlike a Binary Tree where each node has exactly 2 child nodes,
an N-Ary Tree can have multiple child nodes. So we have to do the 
same thing (i.e) We will iterate through the children vector using
a for loop and have recursive call for each of the child nodes.


Code:
   void Preorder(Node* root,vector<int>&ans){
    if(root==NULL){
        return;
    }
    ans.push_back(root->val);
    for(auto it:root->children){
        Preorder(it,ans);
    }
   }
    
    vector<int> preorder(Node* root) {
        vector<int>ans;
        Preorder(root,ans);
        return ans;

    }
