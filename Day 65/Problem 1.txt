Day 65: Problem-1

A school is trying to take an annual photo of all the students. The students are asked to stand in
a single file line in non-decreasing order by height. Let this ordering be represented by the integer 
array expected where expected[i] is the expected height of the ith student in line. You are given an 
integer array heights representing the current order that the students are standing in. Each heights[i] 
is the height of the ith student in line (0-indexed).Return the number of indices where heights[i] != expected[i].

Approach
Sort the array and then compare the both.Make a new array which is sorted then
compare the elements of the same index of both. If same then go to next index 
if not then ans = ans+1 where ans intitially=0.

Code:
       int heightChecker(vector<int>& heights) {
       int n=heights.size();
       vector<int>Exp;
       for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
         Exp.push_back(heights[i]);
       }
       sort(Exp.begin(),Exp.end());
       int cnt=0;
       for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
        if(Exp[i]!=heights[i]){
            cnt++;
        }
       }
       return cnt; 
    }
