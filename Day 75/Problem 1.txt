Day 75: Problem-1

Check a number whether it is divisble by 9.

Input
The input format should be in string.The user receive data
in the form of characters from a stream, where each character 
represents a number. If the character "0" is encountered, the
data stream should terminate. If any character other than digits
 0-9 is encountered, it should not be added to the string. After
forming the string, it needs to be converted into a number and 
checked if it is divisible by 9. 


Approach

Just Simple write code According to Problem statement.

Code:
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main(){
    char c;
    string s;
    
    while(cin>>c){
        if(c=='0'){
            break;
        }
        else if(c>'0' && c<='9'){
            s+=c;
        }
    }
    
    int num=stoi(s);
    if(num%9==0){
        cout<<"Num"<<" "<<num<<" "<<"is divisible by 9"<<endl;
    }
    else{
        cout<<"Num"<<" "<<num<<" "<<"is not divisible by 9"<<endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
