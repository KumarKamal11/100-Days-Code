Day 99: Problem-1

Given an array of strings words, return the first palindromic string in the array.
If there is no such string, return an empty string "". A string is palindromic if 
it reads the same forward and backward.

Example 1:
Input: words = ["abc","car","ada","racecar","cool"]
Output: "ada"
Explanation: The first string that is palindromic is "ada".
Note that "racecar" is also palindromic, but it is not the 
first.
 
Approach:

The Approach is quite simple we have to just iterate over the given list of string
and check if s is palindrome. If s is palindrome then return s. After all iteration 
if we don't find any palindrome return empty string.

Code:

 bool isPalindrome(string &s){
        int st = 0;
        int e = s.length()-1;

        while(st<=e){
            if(s[st]!=s[e]){
                return false;
            }
            st++;
            e--;
        }
        return true;
    }
    string firstPalindrome(vector<string>& words) {
       for(string s:words){
        if(isPalindrome(s)){
            return s;
        }
       }
       return "";
    }
