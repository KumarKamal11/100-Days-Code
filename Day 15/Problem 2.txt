Day 15: Problem-2

Problem:1614. Maximum Nesting Depth of the Parentheses

Problem Link:https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-nesting-depth-of-the-parentheses/description/
Difficulty Level:Easy
Topics: Stack

Approach:
1.Initialize two variables: open to keep track of the number of open parentheses
 encountered so far, and depth to store the maximum nesting depth encountered.
2.Iterate through each character of the string s using a loop.
3.Check if the current character is an opening parenthesis '('.
4.If it is, increment the open counter to indicate that an open parenthesis has been encountered.
5.Check if the current character is a closing parenthesis ')'.
6.If it is, decrement the open counter to indicate that a matching closing parenthesis has been found for an open parenthesis.
7.Update the depth variable to store the maximum of the current depth and the number of open parentheses encountered so far.
8.After iterating through all characters of the string, return the maximum nesting depth encountered.

Code:
 int maxDepth(string s) {
      int open=0;
      int depth=0;
      for(int i=0;i<s.size();i++){
          if(s[i]=='('){
              open++;
            }
         if(s[i]==')'){
             open--;
            }
            depth=max(depth,open);
        }  
        return depth;
    }
