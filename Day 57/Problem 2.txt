Day 57: Problem-2

You are given two strings of the same length s and t. In one
step you can choose any character of t and replace it with 
another character. Return the minimum number of steps to make 
t an anagram of s.An Anagram of a string is a string that contains
the same characters with a different (or the same) ordering.

Approach

Just store the occurence of each character of string which is present in 's'.And we decrease 1 if we 
encounter the same character in t. At the end just count the index value which is greater than zero.

Code:
   int minSteps(string s, string t) {
        int arr[26]={0};
        for(auto it:s){
            arr[it-'a']++;
        }
         for(auto it:t){
            arr[it-'a']--;
        }
        int ans=0;
        for(int i=0;i<26;i++){
            if(arr[i]>0){
                ans+=arr[i];
            }
        }
     return ans;
    }
