Day 60: Problem-1

You are given two positive integers n and k. A factor of an integer n is defined as an integer i where n % i == 0.
Consider a list of all factors of n sorted in ascending order, return the kth factor in this list or return -1 if 
n has less than k factors.

Topics: Number Theory

Approach

The simple Approach of this problem is to store the all possible factors into an array
and after that return the kth element of an array.

Code:
  int kthFactor(int n, int k) {
        vector<int>ans;
        for(int i=1;i<=n;i++)
        {
            if(n%i==0)
            {
                ans.push_back(i);
            }

        }
        if(k<=ans.size()){
        return ans[k-1];
        }
        else{
        return -1;
        }
    }
