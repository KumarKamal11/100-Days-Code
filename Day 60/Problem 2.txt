Given an integer array nums, return the greatest common divisor of the smallest
number and largest number in nums.The greatest common divisor of two numbers is 
the largest positive integer that evenly divides both numbers.

Approach
 To solve this problem we have to find the minimum and maximum element which is present
 in array. After finding these two elements we have to find GCD of these two numbers and 
 return GCD as result.

Code:
  int findGCD(vector<int>& nums) {
        int min=INT_MAX;
        int max=INT_MIN;
        for(int i=0;i<nums.size();i++){
            if(nums[i]>max){
                max=nums[i];
            }
            if(nums[i]<min){
                min=nums[i];
            }
        }
        int gcd=1;
        for(int i=1;i<=max;i++){
            if((min%i==0) && (max%i==0)){
                gcd=i;
            }
        }
        return gcd;
    }
